## Technology
Collage Maker uses Javascript, JQuery, and CSS to make a clean and straightforward interface for creating image collages in the browser. It gives the user complete control over all aspects on the images and where to place them, and even applies a nice Polaroid-style border around them.

## How to Use
Pictures can be added to the collage by simply dragging and dropping them from your computer/Desktop. To modify the images that have been added, you can use the dropdown at the top of the page to change the cursor mode. 

## Future Work
In the future better mobile support is planned, as well as a more intuitive toolbar-style method of selecting the current cursor action rather than using the dropdown. While the dropdown is useable, it could be improved.
